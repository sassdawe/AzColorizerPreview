# AzColorizerPreview

> There was a time when we had to manage so many on-onprem Windows Servers over RDP that the only way to distinglish them was to use different themes on them, for example: red = production, blue = integration and green = development.
  
With the cloud we can easily have the similar problems but within our web browsers: Have you even been lost between the different browser windows or the many Azure subscriptions?

I hope this project will help you out in that matter! 

AzColorizer is here to give you the ability to change the color of the top navigational bar giving you a bit of help on the job.

WIth the most recent update (still being processed by Microsoft) you can set dedicated colors for up to 4 different Azure subscriptions:

You can get the Extension from the [Microsoft Edge Marketplace](https://bit.ly/AzColorizer)

*Chrome and Firefox versions are in the making.*

# Important things to know.

- AzColorizer currently does not support syncronizing settings between browers instances of the users, all settings are stored locally in the browser.
- AzColorizer _while in preview_ does not transit any information back to the developers or any other parties, if/when that changes it will be communicated here.
