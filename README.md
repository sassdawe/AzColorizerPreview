# AzColorizerPreview

Have you even been lost between the different browser windows or the many Azure subscriptions?

I hope this project will help you out in that matter! 

AzColorizer is here to give you the ability to change the color of the top navigational bar giving you a bit of help on the job:

You can get it from the [Microsoft Edge Marketplace](https://bit.ly/AzColorizer)

*Chrome and Firefox versions are in the making.*

# Important things to know.

- AzColorizer currently does not support syncronizing settings between browers instances of the users, all settings are stored locally in the browser.
- AzColorizer _while in preview_ does not transit any information back to the developers or any other parties, if/when that changes it will be communicated here.
